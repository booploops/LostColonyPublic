This is a public repository for the Lost Colony VRChat worlds.

With our worlds and stages we make it a priority to keep the barrier to entry for an amazing experience as accessable as possible.

We typically offer 2-3 options for screen mapping:
- Regular Mapping: This screen mapping is non-specific and designed to work with most visuals without any special setup.
- Pro Mapping: This screen mapping is designed to work with visuals that have been specifically designed for it, utilizing zones on the screen to create a more immersive experience.
- DMX Mapping: Usually derived from the Pro Mapping, but includes space for DMX lighting control.
